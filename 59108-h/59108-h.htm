<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Mississippi Valley Migration.</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The stations and observers, to which these numbers
refer, are given in the O. and O. for April.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A group of entirely different habits and
of comparatively rare occurrence is composed
of the Cape May Warbler, (<i>P. tigrina</i>,)
Bay-breasted Warbler, (<i>D. castanea</i>,)
and the Connecticut Warbler, (<i>O. agilis</i>.)
These all leave the United States to winter,
and pass entirely beyond it to breed;
at least, we know the first two do so, and
it is generally supposed that the last does
also, although its nest and eggs have never
yet been found. No. (30) was the only
observer who saw the first two, and he
found the Cape May Warbler on the 2d of
May, and the Bay-breasted for the first
time May 3d, and the last time both male
and female were seen on the 21st of that
month. Both (30) and (52) observed the
Connecticut Warbler, which is the rarest
regular migrant in the Mississippi Valley,
during the Spring, and on the Fall return
seems to shun its Spring course and passes
southward through New England. No.
(30) saw it on 5-14, 5-18 and the last one
5-24, while (52) procured his first specimen
5-26, and saw it three times afterward,
the last being 5-29. Different in
habits from the rest of their Warbler
brethren are the Warbler Thrushes, the
Golden-crowned Thrush, or Oven-bird, (<i>S.
auricapillus</i>,) the Small-billed Water
Thrush, (<i>S. n&aelig;vius</i>,) and the Large-billed
Water Thrush, (<i>S. motacilla</i>.) Their ranges
differ widely. The bulk of all of them
winter beyond our limits, though a few of
the first remain in Florida, and numbers of
the second are scattered over all the Southern
States and occasionally as far north as
Southern Illinois. But while the first two
breed over all the Mississippi Valley, the
last breeds regularly only to Middle and
Northern Illinois and sometimes as far
north as Southern Minnesota. The first
Golden-crowns reached (30) 4-17, and
passing north with medium speed (38)
found them about 4-26, (52) 4-28, and (51)
on 5-5, while farther west, like the other
Warblers, they were somewhat later, appearing
at (21) on 5-5, and (45) on 5-6.
No. (30) found a nest 5-15, with three
eggs and a Cowbird&rsquo;s, while only three
days before they were just beginning to be
common at (52), and the height of the season
was not until 5-19. The Large-billed
was the earliest of the three to migrate,
arriving at Southern and Central Illinois
about the 10th of April, and at (21) on the
14th, but after that, moving rather slowly,
reached its usual northern limit at (41) on
5-10. It will be convenient to study five
more Warblers together, not because they
migrate at the same time, but because their
places of wintering and breeding are the
same, and their habits, during migration
and even the general appearance of some
of them, are alike. He must have sharp
eyes who can recognize at sight, while in
the trees, the Nashville Warbler, (<i>H. ruficapilla</i>,)
the Orange-crowned Warbler, (<i>H.
celata</i>,) and the Tennessee Warbler, (<i>H.
peregrina</i>;) while the Black-capped Yellow
and the Canadian Fly-catching Warblers,
(<i>M. pusillus</i>) and (<i>M. canadensis</i>,) share
with them a liking for low shrubs, and are
not uncommonly found with them.</p>
<p>The first three spend the Winter in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Southern States and the last two withdraw
entirely from our country. All nest regularly
in British America and more or less
frequently in the northern tier of States.
The Nashville Warbler was seen by (30)
only on 5-2, and by (52) for the first time
5-10. Only five birds were seen before
5-19, then they were more common for a
few days and the last left 5-26. The
Orange-crowned is comparatively rare east
of the Mississippi River. It does occur in
both Illinois and Wisconsin, but was not
seen this year by either (30) or (52.) The
only note is from (57) of one seen 5-14,
but it migrates at the same time or a little
earlier than the Nashville and Tennessee
and is sometimes found in their company.
The Tennessee Warbler is much more
common. Indeed, the banks of Mississippi
seem to be its favorite Spring route. They
reached (30) 4-25 and (21) 5-14. They
were very numerous at (30) from 5-3 to
5-18. By 5-24 the last one was gone.
No. (52) found some females 5-17, but no
males until 5-22. The other two Warblers
are among the last to migrate, and their
passage is usually rather rapid. The
Black-capped Yellow reached (21) on 5-8,
(30) 5-9, and were most numerous there
5-14 to 5-18, the last one leaving 5-21.
At (52) one was seen 5-12, and no more
until 5-20. The height of the season was
5-21, and the last one 5-29. The Canadian
Fly-catching Warbler was observed only at
(52,) where it appeared 5-14 and left 5-24,
and at (52) where the first one was seen
5-24 and the last 5-29. Nearly all the rest
of the Warblers can be considered together.
They are the Blue-winged Yellow,
(<i>H. pinus</i>,) the Golden-winged, (<i>H. chrysoptera</i>,)
the Blue Yellow-backed, (<i>P. americana</i>,)
the Cerulean, (<i>D. C&aelig;rulea</i>,) and
the Mourning Warbler, (<i>G. philadelphia</i>.)
But few notes have been contributed on
these species, which are as a whole, rather
southerly. All are handsome and one, the
Blue Yellow-backed, is the smallest of our
Warblers. All winter beyond our borders
except a few of the Blue-winged Yellow
and the Blue Yellow-backed, that linger
behind in Florida. The Blue-winged Yellow
and the Golden-winged breed regularly
from the Gulf to Northern Illinois, and
casually to Minnesota, and a few of the
latter to British America. They were seen
only by (30) who found a few of the former
in song 4-17, and of the latter, which is
not common anywhere, a fine male in song
was seen 5-2, and both male and female
were seen on the 14th and 15th of May.
The Blue Yellow-backed made its appearance
at (30) 4-17, and remains to breed,
from a little south of St. Louis to British
America. It reached (41) 5-3. No. (52)
saw it the next day, and the next day it
was (57.) The Cerulean Warbler, although
breeding over the whole of the Mississippi
Valley was seen only by (35) who reports
it on 4-11. Among the rather rare Warblers
may be counted the Mourning Warbler,
whose retiring habits make it difficult
to find at any place. It breeds regularly
to Southern Wisconsin, and occasionally to
Middle Minnesota. It was first seen by
(30) 5-16 and three days later at (52) where
for the species it was quite abundant, having
been seen more than a dozen times in
as many different places.</p>
<p>There remains to be treated only three
Warblers, and those all well known. They
are the Chestnut-sided Warbler, (<i>D. pennsylvanica</i>,)
the Black and White Creeper,
(<i>M. varia</i>,) and the Maryland Yellow-throat,
(<i>G. trichas</i>.) Of these the first
entirely leaves the United States for the
Winter; the second almost follows its example,
a few remaining in Florida and
some may remain even farther north, as
(13) found it in December; but the last is
a common Winter resident of all the Southern
States. While the first does not stop
to nest until Northern Illinois is reached,
the other two nest from the Gulf northward.
All three reach British America.</p>
<p>The Chestnut-sided Warbler reached
(30) on 4-27, when an old male was seen,
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
but no more until 5-2. About the middle
of the month it was most numerous, and
the last one left 5-24. At (43) it came 5-5
and four days later at (44.) In the timber
they moved a little faster and appeared at
(52) 5-7. The bulk of the males came 5-12,
followed on the 17th by the females, the
species then being at its height; two days
later, on the 19th, nearly all left. A few
remained to breed&mdash;about four to six pairs
in as many square miles. One nest was
found and the birds seen during all the
month of June. Passing north (57) found
them May 17, and (60) May 20, but as
usual on the prairie (56) did not see them
until later&mdash;May 24.</p>
<p>The Black and White Creeper migrated
somewhat earlier. No. (35) found them
for the first time on 4-10 and the next day
they were quite numerous. On 4-14 the
first arrived at (21,) being almost the only
Warbler which was seen there before it
was at (30,) at which place it did not appear
until fifteen days later, on 4-29. After
this they traveled faster, appearing at (41)
and (52) on 5-3; at (51) and (57) on 5-7;
and at (60) on 5-9. No. (45) found his
first one 5-6. At both (30) and (52) they
were numerous 5-5, but the height of the
season at (52) was not until 5-12. The
Maryland Yellow-throat was found by (13)
all through the Winter, but though remaining
so much farther north than most
Warblers, it was no earlier in its migration.
A few males came to (30) 4-17, and to (38)
4-29. No. (21) reports them 5-3; four
days later (57) saw them and they reached
(60) 5-12, and (56) 5-20. Some other
dates, as for instance, (35) the first one on
4-30, (41) the first 5-8, and the first at (52)
on 5-12, may be taken as later than the
facts of the case, owing to the retiring habits
of the bird and its not being sought in
the marshy spots it usually frequents. At
(30) 5-1 was the height of the season and
four days later the transient visitors departed.&mdash;<i>W.

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Ruby-Crowned Kinglet.</span></h2>
<p>Found one set of eight slightly incubated
eggs, immaculate, 58 &times; 40, 57 &times; 43, 54
&times; 43, 54 &times; 43, 54 &times; 43, 53 &times; 42, 55 &times; 43, 53
&times; 49. Nest on a low pine, in a clearing
that had grown up to underbrush, three or
four feet from the ground. It was pendant
(contrary to Dr. Coues&rsquo; Bds. of Colo.
Val.) from the under side of some small
branches that inclined downward and
about four inches from the stem. It is
much the shape of a &ldquo;R. R. lunch station&rdquo;
coffee cup, but longer and flattened at the
bottom, mainly of green moss interwoven
with the fibrous outer covering of plants.
This fibre also holding it to the twigs. A
very few fine straws are woven into the
lower end. The cavity is quite deep for its
width, lined with soft shreds of burlaps
and re-lined with soft feathers. Altogether
it is a very soft concern. Outer height
6 inches, diameter 4 inches, inner depth
2&frac12; inches, diameter 1&frac34; inches. Am sure of
its identity, as I stood some time with my
face close to the parent on the nest. While
I was packing the nest and eggs the parents
were hopping about, uttering their
loud cherp, cherp, cherp, cherup, that
seemed to be of too much force and volume
for so tiny a creature. Right here let
me make a correction to my mass of mistakes
in the February O. and O. I am not
positive of ever seeing but one pair of
Yellow-crowned Kinglets anywhere near
here. Last year a pair of them alighted
near me while at Murphy, and I took it for
granted that they were all Yellow-crowns.
This season I have paid considerable attention
to the Kinglets, but have failed to see
anything but Ruby-crowns, which are quite
numerous in this locality.</p>
<p>August 1, watched a pair of Kinglets
carrying food to their young, and soon discovered
their nest in the top of a slender
pine about forty feet up. Climbed up, but
the top was so small it would not bear my
weight. So I waited till the young had
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
flown and then felled the tree. This nest,
also, is pensile but not exactly like the
other. It is suspended from small twigs
and connected to the stem by small fibers
caught to the rough bark. It is of moss,
fine grass, plant fiber, very small rootlets,
and a few feathers loosely woven and lined
with soft feathers. Outer diameter 3&frac12;
inches, height 4&frac12; inches, inner diameter 2
inches, depth 2&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>It is amusing to note their antics when a
Jay happens in the vicinity of their nest.
I have often been attracted some distance
by their constant chirp, and find them fluttering
around some sedate looking Jay,
bent on obtaining its breakfast, and at
short intervals pouncing down on its back
as if to impress upon him their importance.
In a corner of the timber near my shanty
I have witnessed these proceedings several
times, and it is a strong indication that their
nest is not far away.&mdash;<i>D. D. Stone, Hancock,
Colorado.</i></p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Short-eared Owl.</span></h2>
<p>This little owl, so far as my observation
has extended, seems peculiar to the coast,
where among the reeds and thick marshes
of the shores and neighboring islands it
finds a covert from the noisy world. Having
found such a place they, unlike all
other New England owls, build in colonies.
A locality not far from here has been
from my earliest recollection a breeding
place for these owls. The situation is
most desirable, being a meadow or flat
level with the coast, over which the tide
completely flows, but leaves it entirely dry
when it recedes. This meadow is covered
with a coarse grass and surrounded by tall
brakes and reeds. In these latter they
gather together the remains of last year&rsquo;s
frost-bitten reeds and place them in a
promiscuous heap on a tussock. This is
afterward hollowed out and the set of
eggs is then laid. Six is the largest number
I ever found, with the exception of one
nest, in which I found ten; but these were
laid by two females who sat together on
the same nest in perfect harmony. Incubation
was difficult to determine, but I
cannot make it out to be more than twenty-one
days. If any of your readers would
be kind enough to give me the exact time
it would be gratefully received. No owl
is more interesting to watch. Take some
dark, cloudy day in May or June, repair to
their haunts and they will be found lightly
skimming over the surface of the ground
seeking for food left by the receding tide,
or again diligently searching the immediate
upland for any unwary mouse. Or watch
them again in the deepening twilight, as
silently, without a single note, they flit
past, seeming but a passing thought or
fanciful vision, until you hear from the
shore the shrill cry of a Tern or Sandpiper
in his talons; then you awaken to the fact
that it is a rapacious bird acting well its
part in nature&rsquo;s great drama, &ldquo;The Survival
of the Fittest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>F. H. Carpenter,

<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">Clarke&rsquo;s Crow in Southeastern Dakota.</span></h3>
<p>A few days ago a farmer called my attention
to two, to him, strange birds eating
corn in his hog pasture. I borrowed his
gun loaded with buckshot, and to my surprise
found the victim to be a Clarke&rsquo;s
crow. Now the question is, what did
these two strangers want here in a country
so unsuited to their wants and habits?
Their nearest habitat from here is 400
miles off in a bee line in the Black Hills,
where they are not uncommon.&mdash;<i>G. Ayersborg,

<p>Is not always pleasant but it is sometimes

we have a small dose of it which we will
administer sugar-coated in behalf of the
little fellows that are growing up and will
soon be among us giving us old stagers
ideas of observations we never dreamed of.</p>
<p>Some years ago there was an ornithological
association formed in Cambridge,
Mass., which has not accomplished the task
it set out to do, and for several reasons&mdash;1st.
It has been too exclusive&mdash;too much
of the Pharisee order&mdash;it has ignored the
&ldquo;bone and sinew&rdquo; of our beautiful science,
and it could not saw its own wood. 2d.
It has hung out false colors. It advertised
year after year that it was the &ldquo;only, &amp;c.,&rdquo;
until we gently reminded them that the
world would notice it when the sign was
taken in. 3d. It has announced as its
editors, Prof. S. F. Baird and Dr. Elliott
Coues. We, as a corresponding member,
have ventured to protest against this deception.
We were told that Prof. Baird
would not like it if his name was removed,
and that it had a good effect abroad, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. One member informed us that &ldquo;<i>all</i>&rdquo;
the proof was submitted to Dr. Coues.
We cannot contradict this, but outsiders
don&rsquo;t believe it, and all of this is a load
that the Nuttall Club has failed to carry to
its destination. A meeting of the most
exclusive kind has recently been held in
New York. And this convention of scientists
have named their new society &ldquo;The
American Ornithological Union.&rdquo; The mistake
is, it is not American, and it is formed
too much on the principle of our city social
clubs where each member carries a
Yale key. It won&rsquo;t work in science, gentlemen;
all nature belongs to all men. You
sadly mistake the importance of this mission.
It matters little what you call him,
the Blue Jay screams just as loud for rich
and poor, for boy and man alike. It is a
mystery to us why the names of our birds
should be such a bone of contention. It
always reminds us of a lawyer discovering
during a trial a nice point of law and forgetting
that he has a client to look after.
We are told that great harmony prevailed
and that the disturbing element that has
existed so long in our science has calmed
down like a bright May morning.</p>
<p>Boston has six members while the State
of Yale and Dr. Wood, Coe, Sage and
Clark were ignored. R. I. was too small to
be remembered; all birds passing through
R. I. will be expected to stop at Cambridge
and register, and yet the State of Rhode
Island is big enough to hold our friend
Jencks, and occasionally a rare bird
gets one wing over the State. There
were six members from Mass., four from
Washington, seven from New York, one
each from Oregon, Louisiana, Iowa, and
Maine, two from Canada, and J. M. Wheaton
from Ohio, whose last work should be
read by all seeking advanced knowledge.
Prof. Maynard seems to have been overlooked,
and yet he was studying bird life
when many of the present members were
toddling around in petticoats. We do not
agree with Maynard, but we recognize his
right all the same, and fortunately no
Union can curtail that right. We are sorry
to say he is not well and will winter in
the tropics, and as the Union is not represented
south of New York the birds will
not have heard of it. This purely American?
Union did not consider the editor of
this paper and all his correspondents as
worthy of a seat in the gallery even&mdash;but
we believe some of them were elected corresponding
members, which means that they
will be allowed to study bird life and send
their notes to some member who will condescend
to assume the honor of editing,
and yet the birds come and go with the
season.</p>
<p>The convention was unique. It brought
together a remarkable body of men
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
that nothing else could have done.
There was Prof. S. F. Baird, who to our
regret and great loss gave up his first love
and went a fishing. There was that model
scientist Geo. N. Laurence, not &ldquo;American,&rdquo;
but of the world. The learned Allen
from Cambridge was there who gives
us the technical &ldquo;straight.&rdquo; The Doctors
were there in force. Dr. Shufeldt from
La., who commences to study our game
birds just where we like to leave them.
Dr. J. B. Holden and Dr. A. K. Fisher,
Sing Sing, N. Y., who reads the O. and O.
and of course keeps posted, and Dr. Edgar
A. Mearns of Highland Falls, N. Y.,
who wrote a good thing on the Birds of
N. Y., and forgot to send a copy to this
office. Dr. C. Hart Merriam was there a
moving spirit. His style and accuracy
will tell in the secretary&rsquo;s chair. The
hard working Dr. Elliott Coues was there,
whose graceful pen and kindness of heart
has led him to endorse men who were n. g.
in the science. Brewster of Cambridge,
Purdie from under the gilded dome, and
Chamberlain from over the border was
there, and many others not well known to
us as they are not advanced enough in ornithology
to read the latest news from the
bird world in the O. and O.</p>
<p>Robert Ridgway, who has so carefully
corrected the errors in O. and O., was
there. The boys in the west noticing this
trait have honored a newly formed club
with his name; and may its constitution be
like the science it advocates, broad enough
to admit all honest workers on this continent.
The ornithologist and oologist of
this generation, Capt. Chas. E. Bendire,
left Fort Klamah, Oregon, on receipt of
notice of the meeting, and reached New
York at 7 a. m. on the morning of the day
of the meeting. While others are wasting
valuable time over the name of a bird, the
Captain has been raking in the birds and
eggs to an extent little thought of. Although
stationed in the wilderness he is
better posted on eastern collections than
any other man. The following officers
were elected: Pres. J. A. Allen; Vice Pres.,
Dr. Elliott Coues and Robert Ridgway;
Sec. and Treas., Dr. C. Hart Merriam,

<p>Late in October,
1882, a Downy Woodpecker excavated a
hole in an old cherry tree, near a much
used door in my yard, of the size and shape
of its usual nest, and occupied it nightly
for more than six weeks. In April following
a pair of Bluebirds took possession
and reared two broods of five birds each;
but now, October 2d, &rsquo;83, the Woodpecker
has occupied his old quarters for several
nights and frequents the locality during
the day. This habit of the Downy in making
a winter home is a new one to me.&mdash;<i>John

<h3 id="c9"><span class="sc">Least Bittern.</span></h3>
<p>While collecting on a
large marshy meadow in this vicinity on
June 10th, 1883, I started a Least Bittern
from a clump of flags. Thinking there
might be a nest there, I commenced
searching and soon found it. It was a
mere hollow in a bunch of matted flags
scantily lined with water grass, and contained
two fresh laid eggs. In shape and
size they resembled eggs of the Yellow-billed
Cuckoo. In color they were of pale
blue, almost white. Fearing other collectors
might find them I took them, though
probably not a complete set. I also secured
the bird. I afterwards secured three
more finely plumaged males on the same
meadows, which are now in my cabinet.&mdash;<i>Charles

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">The Hawks of &rsquo;83.</span></h2>
<p>The first March walks in the woods
showed that many of the old hawks&rsquo; nests
were &ldquo;winter killed?&rdquo; Weakened and
disintegrated by the action of the
constant snow and ice, they had been
tumbled from the trees by the last fierce
breath of winter. So at the outset it was
clear that to secure the annual complement
of eggs would involve wider and closer
search than usual. Though shadowing
them closely, I was finally baffled as to the
nesting-places of several pairs of these
evicted hawks, and the season&rsquo;s work gave
but eighty eggs against over 100 for the
year before. Still the hawks were as common
as ever and will continue so, doubtless,
as long as their chief quarry the red
squirrel is so abundant here. In this series
the sets of Red-tailed were all in pairs,
and the Red-shouldered all in trios&mdash;the
Red-tailed of course being larger and less
showily marked. In average sets of <i>borealis</i>
one egg will be plain and the other
nearly so, while in a large series of Red-shouldered
there will be some half dozen
types constantly recurring, many gradations,
and a few sets of absolute brilliancy.
Though the season was cold and late, the
Red-tailed bred as early as usual, while its
congener showed itself as heretofore affected
by extreme weather in the breeding
season.</p>
<p>In blowing the incubated eggs of <i>B.
lineatus</i>, three sets were found which held
one stale egg each. It is not clear that
cold or wet caused this, but it is true that
a wet season makes the Buteo&rsquo;s eggs dull
and nest-stained. A single heavy rain, occurring
when the clutch is just laid, affects
their brightness and beauty. And full
sets suffer by comparison with single eggs
taken when laid, as every day of exposure
fades all hawk&rsquo;s eggs. So the series of &rsquo;83
is uninteresting and dull as a whole, while
&rsquo;82, which was a dry season, presents a
uniformly showy lot. To remove nest-stains
is not easy. If freshly laid the
markings will at once wash out of the eggs
of Fish Hawks and Buteos, so the corner
of a damp cloth only should be used on
the plain surface between the markings.
Dr. Wood says soap and water are cheap
and should be freely used. But as eggshells
are porous, soap is at once absorbed
in the shell and afterwards when heated
comes out over the surface in yellow, waxy
exudations.</p>
<p>The Buteo&rsquo;s eggs of this season were all
from the old haunts of last year, and presumably
most of them were from hawks&rsquo;
which had been often robbed. I also took
sets of Cooper&rsquo;s Hawks and Marsh Hawks
from old birds grown wary by the loss of
many clutches. Tuesday, June 26, I took
a set of three bright eggs of Sharp-shinned
Hawk from a new nest in a secluded
swamp after leaving them vainly seven
days for a larger set. A pair of Sharp-shinned
with unfledged young were shot
in a hemlock clump within the city limits,
in July this year, by milkmen, who nailed
the hapless family on the side of a barn as
scare-crows. Now, if I had only gone
through the grove in June, as I always
have done in former years, the old birds
might be alive to-day, and my collection
the richer by one more set of Sharp-shinned
hawk&rsquo;s eggs.&mdash;<i>J. M. W., Norwich,

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">Baltimore Oriole.</span></h2>
<p>On looking over some of the back numbers
of the O. and O., I noticed a query as
to the adaptability of the Baltimore Oriole
(<i>Icterus galbula</i>) to cage life. I happen
to be in a position to answer that, when
taken young, and when a reasonable amount
of care is bestowed on it, it makes an excellent
cage bird. I know of one which
was taken from the nest in July, 1879,
and he is apparently as healthy and happy
as any of his confreres, who are in the full
enjoyment of their liberty. He is quite
tame, and very fond of his mistress, and
he shows his affection plainly by his manner
when she approaches his cage. He
will eat almost anything, but he is particularly
fond of hard boiled egg, bread and
finely chopped meat. He has also a great
partiality for fresh fruit; but if that cannot
be obtained, he takes very kindly to
any kind of preserves, as a substitute. He
will eat all kinds of bird-seed, if previously
bruised with a rolling-pin, but not otherwise.
He has never known an hour&rsquo;s illness;
his song is as loud, clear and varied
as that of any Oriole I have ever heard,
and he sings continually. During our long
and severe Winter great care is necessary
to prevent the Orioles suffering from the
cold, and for this reason an old shawl is
thrown over his cage every evening, and
removed in the morning. He has got so
used to this that during the cold weather
he watches for the shawl every night, and
refuses to go to sleep without it. But the
most remarkable thing about him is that
he is in beautiful plumage, with not a
feather soiled or broken, although his cage
is not a particularly large one.&mdash;<i>W. L.
Scott, Ottawa, Canada.</i></p>

<p>Dec. 21, 1882,
Jack sang his full notes for the first time;
on the 26th sang his canary notes, while
bunched up like a sick bird, as usual; sang
several times through January, and soon
got into his full notes, and sang as loud as
ever, it being his fifth year. July 6, when
in his prime, he was stolen from his cage
on the piazza. We found him in a bird
store in the city and bought him back. It
was a severe strain on him; he was not so
lively afterward, but sang up to October.
To-day, Nov. 22, 1883, he is in as fine condition
as he ever was, but not in song.
He will consume nearly his full weight in
celery each day, besides his regular feed.</p>

<p>Dr. Reichenow,
the ornithologist of the Berlin
Museum, describes a new ostrich, under
the name of <i>Struthio molybdophanes</i>. A
living example is in the Zoological Gardens
at Berlin. The habitat of this species is
stated to be the deserts of Somali Land
and the Western Galla Country, extending
on the east coast of Africa from 10 deg.
N. lat. to the Equator.&mdash;<i>Land and Water.</i></p>
<h3 id="c15"><span class="sc">Least Bittern.</span></h3>
<p>While collecting on a
large marshy meadow in this vicinity on
June 10th, 1883, I started a Least Bittern
from a clump of flags. Thinking there
might be a nest there, I commenced
searching and soon found it. It was a
mere hollow in a bunch of matted flags
scantily lined with water grass, and contained
two fresh laid eggs. In shape and
size they resembled eggs of the Yellow-billed
Cuckoo. In color they were of pale
blue, almost white. Fearing other collectors
might find them, I took them, though
probably not a complete set. I also secured
the bird. I afterwards secured three
more finely plumaged males on the same
meadows, which are now in my cabinet.&mdash;<i>Charles

<p>Enclosed please find a photograph of a
pair of Owls which have been on exhibition
here for two or three weeks. The
owner says they are the only pair in the
United States of North America, and are
native birds of Tartary. The photo is
a very fair representation. He calls them
&ldquo;Monkey-faced Owls.&rdquo; The bill proper is
very small, but the mouth extends almost
to the eyes. Eyes as near as I could see
were very small. Iris dark hazel. Back
dark brown, marked very finely, breast
speckled with brown, bill blackish, crown
finely mottled, no tufts, tarsi long. Two
pair were taken at the fort at St. Augustine,
Florida, last February. One pair was
bought for some scientific institute in
Ohio but escaped. P. T. Barnum, the man
says, offered him $500 but he refused.</p>
<p>If they are American birds they are a
cross of Barn Owl and something else.&mdash;<i>W.
P. Tarrant, Saratoga.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A specimen of the &ldquo;Monkey-faced Owl,&rdquo; a rare bird, was
recently captured by Captain Pitts, of Orlando, Fla., in the
Everglades. It is described as being somewhat smaller than
the Hooting Owl. The plumage has the soft, furry texture
of the owl family, but a tinge of orange enters into the
color. The head and face are those of a baboon, the face
being white, while the eyes are much smaller than those of
an owl of the same size, coal-black and somewhat almond-shaped,
opening and closing with lids like those of an animal.
In fact, they more nearly resemble the eyes of an
otter than a bird.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">Interesting Notes.</span></h2>
<p>The article in September O. and O. about
Flying Squirrels reminded me of my experience
with a tame Gray Squirrel that I
had last year. I had a number of stuffed
birds standing on the mantel in my room,
unprotected. The <i>Sciurus</i> had the run of
the room, and one day took it into his head
to gnaw off the bills of every bird he could
find. He must have eaten them, for I
could find no trace of them anywhere, and
I was afraid at first he had poisoned himself,
but no evil effects followed. One day
while out collecting I saw a Kingbird engaged
in a fight with a Great-crested Flycatcher,
and in a few moments the latter
fell to the ground completely exhausted,
and probably injured internally, as I could
find no marks on it except a badly bunged
eye. I took it home and placed it in a
cage open at the top, and after a few minutes
absence, returned just in time to find
that Master <i>Sciurus</i> had climbed into the
cage, killed the bird and was engaged in
gnawing its bill, ruining its value as a
specimen, for which I had intended it. After
that I was careful to leave no birds
where he could get at them.</p>
<p>In the summer of last year I found a
nest which I have never been able to identify,
as no bird was near. It was in New
Castle Co., Del., and was placed in the centre
of a clump of hazel bushes, growing in
a swamp, so that I had to wade at least
fifty yards before reaching it. It resembled
a Wood Thrush&rsquo;s nest, being built of
mud, but was an inch deeper than any
nest of that kind I ever saw. The diameter
was about the same. It was placed
about two feet above the water and contained
four eggs, much like a runt Catbird&rsquo;s
egg, and of a dark blue color, with a
slight greenish cast. The latter is hardly
distinguishable when placed beside a Catbird&rsquo;s
egg. Now can any reader of O. and
O. tell me what bird it belongs to? It was
not a case of a Catbird laying in an old
nest, for I had been through that same
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
thicket several times before, and would
have seen it. If any one can cite an instance
of a Catbird building a mud nest,
that may solve the question, and the slight
differences in size, shape and color might
be passed over as accidental. In visiting
a colony of Purple Grackles I found another
curious set. There is no doubt of their
identity for I saw the female on the nest,
which was a common P. G&rsquo;s nest. There
were four eggs; three of them dark brown,
scratched, mottled and blotched all over
with darker brown. The fourth was a
light olive green, with large blotches of
light brown or bronze. There were no
scratches of any kind on this egg and all
the colors were very light, though entirely
different from a normal Grackle egg, as
well as from the other three. An experienced
collector to whom I showed one of
the dark eggs (without telling its history)
pronounced it a Nighthawk&rsquo;s (<i>Chordeiles
popetue</i>) egg. I don&rsquo;t suppose this is a
new species, but it certainly is a curious
freak of nature.</p>
<p>I would like to correct a couple of the
printer&rsquo;s errors in my note on the Pigeon
Hawk&rsquo;s nest in O. and O. for September.
The date, &ldquo;March 2&rdquo; should read &ldquo;March
22,&rdquo; and in the sentence &ldquo;marked unevenly
with five dots of reddish brown&rdquo; read
&ldquo;fine dots.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Charles D. Gibson, Renovo,
Pennsylvania.</i></p>
<h3 id="c19"><span class="sc">A Surprised Bluejay.</span></h3>
<p>At the back end
of my store, and just outside of a window,
is a box on which we mix the dough to feed
the chicks. On Sunday morning when I
shaved myself I took my mirror to the window
so I could have a good light. Just as
I finished my work I noticed an old Bluejay
drop down on the box and begin eating
the dough from the pan of chicken
feed. As I was on the opposite side of
the glass it did not see me. I looked at it
for a moment and then &ldquo;for fun&rdquo; turned
the mirror around so the glass would face
the bird. It was just taking a mouthful of
dough as it looked up and saw, as it supposed,
another Jay with its mouthful also.
It seemed greatly astonished and failed to
swallow its food for some time, but soon
did so, and then in Bluejay style &ldquo;bowed,&rdquo;
as much as to say &ldquo;good morning, sir.&rdquo;
As a matter of course the glass made the
other Jay bow also, and the next salutation
was &ldquo;kechunk! kechunk!&rdquo; I suppose
that is Jay language, but I do not understand
it. Then it proceeded to fill its
mouth full of dough again and its shadow
did the same. This seemed to anger it
very much, and after giving one Bluejay
war-whoop, it flew against the glass. Its
astonished look at the result of its attack
was laughable. The first thing it did was
to retreat to the farther side of the box,
and from there eye the antagonist. After
gazing for some time its hunger overcome
it and it took another mouthful, &ldquo;as did
its shadow.&rdquo; The Jay stopped with full
mouth, turned its head first one way then
the other, and finally hopped around the
glass and stood face to face with me. Our
faces were not more than six inches apart,
and I never expect to see a more astonished
look than was in its eyes just then.
But one look was enough; and after another
big Jay yell it made as good time
from there as a Bluejay ever made, I guess;
and my dough has remained undisturbed
ever since.&mdash;<i>S. H. N., McLeanborough,
Ill., in Germantown Telegraph.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
